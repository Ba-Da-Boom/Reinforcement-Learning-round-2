# s_invader_game
This is another version of the Space invader I create lately with pygame.
I adapt the game with the PLE (Pygame Learning Environment) which i thank a lot for creating an Environnement of Reinforcement Learning

# Installation
1.You need to install python3 (see for installation : https://www.python.org/)

2.You need to install pygame (see for installation : https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

3.install pillow with : python3 -m pip install Pillow

4.install matplotlib with : python -m pip install -U matplotlib

# Starting the game

1.cd PyGame-Learning-Environment/ple/games/

2.Starting the game with the dumb neural network :
   python3 space_i.py -d <br> </br>
2.Starting the game with the intelligent neural network with the socket <br> </br>
  python3 space_i.py -i  <br> </br>
2.For help <br> </br>
  python3 space_i.py -h <br> </br>

3.Have fun folks ...


# TODO

- [ ] add some plot to compare the Intelligent_neural_network to Dumb_neural_network with a socket (did it but failed need to do it again) <br> </br>
- [ ] implement some DQN
